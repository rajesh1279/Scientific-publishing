# Problem with current publishing 

**A Brief Description of the Project**

## Table of Contents

1. It is driven by greed, not love of discovery or helping out 
2. A particular way of thinking  or particular direction of research which is worth of publication 
Is forced 
Restricting the flow of ideas in a particular direction , which is against the scientific principle 
3. Review in done only once and it is not verified over and over , repeatability is way so something get credibility 

No scope of improvement of already published papers 
4. No space for small contribution but we all know that those small discussion among peer is what 
Make a new idea click, leads to progress, 

5. All form of contribution are not acknowledged, like someone improving the readability 
Or improving  dataset  or code and so on or making minor or major corrections
No control over policy making , and redaction, price setting and other aspect of policy making 
Like use of AI tools 

6. Rewards of free labor is taken by published but it should be shared 
Either for reviewer or publisher or improver, 


7. No place publishing for people  who are not in academics, 

8. Reputation is controlled by journal, it is a form of elitism, less known author find difficult to get entry there 

# What We plan to do, 

## table of content
1 .Build a democratically controlled , owned and managed platform 
For the scientist by the scientist 

2. A open and continuous peer review process that acknowledge all form of contributions 

3. A minimal fee imposed on publishing and whatever is the money earned, that to be decided by community of review which are democratically selected by all platform users 

4. A clear and publicly available algo the decide the value of paper, on this part I have worked out some algo, they do converge, and solution is not very obvious as bad actor will try their best to misuse it, it got to be robust from any form of manipulation, 


# Building community and financial bone,  
There is nothing free in the world, we need money which can collected by all members , grants 
But not by private investor, because profit is not our aim,
In the end we money for everything in this world so making it 
free though enticing will not work 

believe me guys 
Though I have not done  the calculation it can be done 
Particular in india they are lot of good software people available 
At relatively modest salary
