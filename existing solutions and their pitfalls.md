** There are some solutions available  in this direction, but I don't belive they could be as sucessful as the existing publication,
In this, article I dicuss  the problem with them specifically**
# existing solutions best to worst  
1. OSF,pkp, arxiv

# Problems other than funding 
1. None of these is an end to end system.
2. lack of feed back machanism to establish crediblity
3. No cost of submitting it wrong , or reward for honesty, transperancy, quality writing.



# Unsustainable funding 


# problem of copying/ plagarism, due to open source 
1. Lets say someone, starts a project, does the preregistration, states hypothesis beforehand,
2. Someone else takes that idea and publishesh the result of hypothesis beofore the orginal creator, without acknowledging
3. Then value of original author will decrease,
